## What this program is about?
This program is about simulation using monte carlo algorithm in order to estimate $\pi$ value. <hr width=0>

Monte carlo is an algorithm to simulate stochastic events based on certain distribution and for this purpose it is just simple uniform distribution.
Monte Carlo stochastic algorithm for pi estimation</br>

## What I learned during the process?




## What to do next?
This is an on-going projects using Java, in the next version I will ad time events listener to better visualize monte-carlo simulation for pi estimation.
