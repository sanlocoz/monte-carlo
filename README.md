# monte-carlo

> *"Creativity is the ability to introduce order into the randomness of nature"* - Eric Hoffer

## What is this program about?
This program is about simulation using monte carlo algorithm in order to estimate $\pi$ value. Monte carlo is an algorithm to simulate stochastic events based on certain distribution and for this purpose it is just simple uniform distribution. <br>

*Finished state of the program*

The idea behind this program is to simulate randomized dot marking in each timestep in a space of a circle that is enclosed within a square. We count and separate the dots as follows:
- **Blue dots**: the dots that lie within the circle.
- **Red dots**: the dots that lie outside the circle and within the square.




## What things that I learned during the process?




## What to do next?
This is an on-going projects using Java, in the next version I will ad time events listener to better visualize monte-carlo simulation for pi estimation.
